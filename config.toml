  Hi, this is Mayur. I'm documenting my learning notes & projects in this blog. I love building robots ü§ñ been doing so since I was 14 (robowars used to be my Fav competition and won 30+ National robotics competitions growing up) üèÜ

  Now I'm a Staff Robotics & Computer Vision engineer from London, England, working with big boys doing serious stuff I guess üò≥
  
  I have a thing for deep ideas üí≠ and trying to find the obvious truths around our existence (it's definitely harder than it sounds). During my limited free time, I enjoy getting lost in them and for some reason I enjoy reading books on long train journeys üöÜ.
