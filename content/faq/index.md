# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is this blog about?
I am Building Physical Intelligence for Real-World Robots ü§ñ. Sharing my notes and experinces as a robotics enginner. 

## Who are you?
I'm Mayur ‚ò∫Ô∏è, Building Physical Intelligence for Real-World Robots ü§ñ. I'm a Staff AI & Robotics Engineer specializing in Multi-agent Vision Language Action (VLA) systems, with a background in Advanced Robotics & AI from Bristol University and experience at Bristol Robotics Lab. I focus on developing intelligent systems that bridge the gap between vision, language, and robotic actions for general-purpose robotic manipulators.

## What do you write about?
Paper reviews, technical implementations, book summaries, and occasional YouTube video content about robotics, computer vision, and AI. My current focus is on:
- Multi-agent VLA systems for general-purpose robotic manipulators
- Advanced vision models for manufacturing process monitoring
- Learning-by-demonstration systems for industrial robotics
